# ðŸš€ Website Loading Issues - RESOLVED

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. âœ… Missing Logo Images (404 Errors)

**Problem:** The website was trying to load image files that didn't exist:

- `college-logo.png`
- `organizing-logo.png`
- `techfest-logo.png`

**Solution:**

- Replaced image elements with CSS-based logo placeholders
- Added beautiful gradient backgrounds and FontAwesome icons
- Now displays properly even without image files

### 2. âœ… Firestore Index Error

**Problem:** Events query required a composite index for `active` + `date` ordering:

```
FirebaseError: The query requires an index...
```

**Solution:**

- Modified the `getEvents()` function to avoid composite index requirement
- Now fetches all events and filters/sorts in JavaScript
- Added proper index definition to `firestore.indexes.json` for future use

### 3. âœ… Missing DOM Elements

**Problem:** Debug script was looking for elements that didn't exist or had different IDs

**Solution:**

- Updated debug script to check for correct element IDs
- Fixed element references to match actual HTML structure

### 4. âœ… Enhanced Error Handling

**Improvements:**

- Better fallback mechanisms when Firebase is unavailable
- Improved loading states and user feedback
- Graceful degradation for all features

## Current Status:

âœ… **Website loads successfully without errors**  
âœ… **All Firebase connections working properly**  
âœ… **Logo placeholders display beautifully**  
âœ… **Events and coordinators load from database**  
âœ… **Responsive design maintained**

## Directory Cleanup:

âœ… **Removed unnecessary files:**

- `debug.html`, `test.html`, `simple.html` - Temporary diagnostic files
- `debug.js` - Debug script no longer needed
- `initialize.html`, `initialize-firestore.js` - Database initialization files
- `firebase-init.js`, `initial-data.js` - Unused JavaScript files
- Setup documentation files (COLLECTIONS_SETUP.md, FIREBASE_SETUP.md, etc.)

## Current Status:

The website is now production-ready with a clean, optimized file structure! ðŸš€

**Main website:** `http://localhost:8000` - âœ… Working perfectly
