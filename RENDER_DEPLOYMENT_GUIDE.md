✅ **404 Errors Resolved** - All required assets are now present

**Your site should now deploy successfully!** 🎉

## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites ✅

- [x] Firebase project configured and working locally
- [x] GitHub repository with your code pushed
- [x] Render account (free tier available at render.com)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository 📁

1. **Commit all changes to your repository:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix MIME types, Firebase timeouts, and add reliability improvements for Render"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify these files are in your root directory:**
   - ✅ `render.yaml` (deployment configuration)
   - ✅ `package.json` (Node.js configuration)
   - ✅ `index.html` (main website file)
   - ✅ `assets/` folder (CSS, JS, images)
   - ✅ `admin/` folder (admin pages)
   - ✅ `events/` folder (event pages)

### Step 2: Create Render Service 🌐

1. **Go to Render Dashboard:**

   - Visit [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Log in to your account

2. **Create New Static Site:**
   - Click "New +" button
   - Select "Static Site"
3. **Connect Your Repository:**

   - Choose "Connect a repository"
   - Select your GitHub account
   - Choose repository: `VedantMeshram07/miniTech`
   - Click "Connect"

4. **Configure Build Settings:**

   ```
   Name: techfest-website
   Branch: main
   Build Command: echo "Static site build complete"
   Publish Directory: ./
   ```

   **Important:** Render will automatically use your `render.yaml` file which includes MIME type fixes.

### Step 3: Firebase Configuration 🔥

**Important:** Since we're using a static site, Firebase configuration is embedded in the code. No environment variables needed in Render dashboard for Firebase.

The configuration is automatically handled by:

- `assets/js/env-loader.js` (loads Firebase config)
- `assets/js/firebase-config.js` (initializes Firebase)

### Step 4: Deploy! 🚀

1. **Start Deployment:**

   - Click "Create Static Site"
   - Render will automatically deploy from your main branch

2. **Monitor Build Process:**

   - Watch the build logs in Render dashboard
   - Look for "Deploy succeeded" message

3. **Your Site URL:**
   - Default: `https://your-repo-name.onrender.com`
   - Custom domain (optional): Configure in Render settings

### Step 5: Verify Deployment ✅

1. **Check Website Loading:**

   - Visit your Render URL
   - Verify all pages load correctly
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Test Firebase Functionality:**

   - Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for these messages:
     ```
     ✅ Firebase configuration is complete
     🎉 Firebase initialization complete!
     ✅ Firestore initialized
     ```

3. **Test Admin Panel:**
   - Visit `/admin/login.html`
   - Try logging in with Firebase credentials
   - Check if events can be added/edited

### Step 6: Custom Domain (Optional) 🌍

1. **Add Custom Domain in Render:**

   - Go to your service settings
   - Click "Custom Domains"
   - Add your domain (e.g., techcarvaan2025.com)

2. **Configure DNS:**
   - Add CNAME record pointing to your Render URL
   - Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Build Fails

**Problem:** Build command fails
**Solution:**

- Check `render.yaml` syntax
- Ensure `package.json` exists
- Verify all files are committed to Git

### MIME Type Issues (FIXED ✅)

**Problem:** "Refused to execute script" or "MIME type" errors
**Solution:**

- ✅ **Already fixed** in `render.yaml` with proper Content-Type headers
- Files are now served with correct MIME types

### Firebase Not Initializing (FIXED ✅)

**Problem:** Firebase services are null/undefined or timeout errors
**Solution:**

- ✅ **Already fixed** with improved initialization timing
- Check browser console for Firebase initialization logs
- Look for "✅ Firebase initialization completed successfully"

### Events Not Loading

**Problem:** Events section shows "No events found"
**Solution:**

- Check Firestore security rules
- Verify events collection has data
- Check browser console for permission errors

### Images/Assets Not Loading

**Problem:** 404 errors for images or CSS files  
**Solution:**

- Verify file paths are relative (no leading slash)
- Check all assets are committed to Git
- Ensure file names match exactly (case sensitive)

## File Structure Verification 📋

Your deployment should have this structure:

```
/
├── index.html              (main page)
├── render.yaml            (deployment config)
├── package.json           (Node.js config)
├── assets/
│   ├── css/              (stylesheets)
│   ├── js/               (JavaScript files)
│   └── images/           (images)
├── admin/
│   ├── login.html        (admin login)
│   └── dashboard.html    (admin dashboard)
└── events/
    └── details.html      (event details)
```

## Performance Optimization 🚀

### Enable Caching

Add to your `render.yaml`:

```yaml
headers:
  - path: /assets/*
    name: Cache-Control
    value: public, max-age=86400
```

### Security Headers

Already configured in your `render.yaml`:

- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Monitoring & Updates 📊

### Automatic Deployments

- Any push to `main` branch triggers automatic deployment
- Monitor deployments in Render dashboard

### Manual Redeployment

1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

### Rollback

1. Go to "Deploys" tab in Render dashboard
2. Find previous successful deployment
3. Click "Promote to Live"
